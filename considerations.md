# About format

* Let's estimate a certain amount of time for each block (if it was to be taught completely)

* We can plan 2 or 3 formats
    * 3h ACL-type tutorial on VI (targeting those who want to play with DGMs in particular)
    * 3x3h tutorial on VI (that's more or less the format DCU is asking us)
    * 4 weeks course (I have a bunch of very good students asking for something like one of UvA's June courses)

We can give each type of tutorial a certain symbol and then mark parts of modules (or entire modules) as they would fit each type of tutorial.
